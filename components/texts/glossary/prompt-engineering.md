A language corpus is a collected body of spoken language transcribed for linguistic research. It is meant to be a representative of a kind of naturally-occurring language.

This is analogous to the language data LLMs are trained on.

Examples of language corpora include the Penn Treebank, Europarl, OpenSubtitles, and ParaCrawl. Each of these draw their language data from different sources.
