Machine learning is when computer systems are able to learn and adapt behaviors without explicit instructions by using algorithms and models to react to patterns in data and adapt.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. In this case, the A.I. is not programmed for every specific scenario (like in classical computing), but can handle them by learning these patterns.
