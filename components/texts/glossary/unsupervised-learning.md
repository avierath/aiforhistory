Unsupervised learning teaches AI to read data by inputting unlabeled data into a neural network. This forces the network to learn to recognize patterns without the help of labels. This allows for large data quantities to be processed but can lead to more pervasive issues with the data like harmful content or biases because of lack of human evaluation.
