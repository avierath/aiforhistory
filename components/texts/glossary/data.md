Data is the raw information used to train artificial intelligence. Datasets are big collections of this information. 

The goal is always to train AI on as much data as possible to make its outputs more reliable. This is because there is more information for the computer to draw conclusions from. If a dataset is too limited or not diverse enough, the AI will regurgitate these same biases in its predictions.

A major problem in AI data use calls into question the origins of this training data. Not only due to reproduction of aforementioned biases, but also issues of copyright and intellectual property (see scraping).
