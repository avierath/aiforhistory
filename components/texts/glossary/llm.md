Large language models (or LLMs) are softwares trained on large bodies of human language (see language corpus) for both analysis and prediction of speech and text. In the case of artificial intelligence, LLMs process written instructions and generate text. Much of this reflects practices in computational linguistics.

Most of the language these models are trained on are sourced from literature or the internet (see scraping and data).

Examples of LLMs include ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
