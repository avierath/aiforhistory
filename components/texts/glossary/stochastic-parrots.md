Stochastic parrots is a label given to LLMs trained on such a large dataset that they simply act as predictive engines where they give successive words only in an effort to replicate patterns in training data (think autocorrect). This argument thus claims that stochastic parrots thus cannot represent true artificial-intelligence.
