A neural network is a [machine learning] algorithm derived from the function of neurons in the human brain. Neural networks are algorithms (or a series of algorithms) that work together to understand and judge information. 

Data is input into a neural network and it in turn produces an output such as a prediction or classification of the data. The nodes between these “neurons” try to make the data more closely resemble the input data.
