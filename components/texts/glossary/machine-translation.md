Machine translation is the use of computers to translate from one language to another. While understanding that some aspects of languages are universal, the process of machine translation has to account for how word order changes between languages and match translations based on the part of speech and semantic meanings of the sentences’s components.

Machine translation uses supervised learning where the computer is trained on translated sentences that have already been matched.
