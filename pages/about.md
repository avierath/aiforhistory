# About AI for Historians

Much of the academic literature on [[artificial-intelligence]] is not geared towards historians, yet the discipline has come under more and more pressure to "modernize" and embrace a technological future. This project is meant to demystify LLMs (as the kinds of AI that are are at the core of scholarly debates for AI in research and the classroom) and hopefully artificial intelligence as a whole. Hopefully, when historians can be fully informed about the tools, consequences, and abilities of this kind of technology, they can make the decision that suits them and their research the best.

The goal right now is to produce a useful glossary of terms to help me as I persue my own research on this matter. Moving forward, I have stories planned to explain how [[llm|LLMs]] like ChatGPT work (starting with an understanding of [[computational-linguistics]]), explore costs of using these kinds of generative AI, and assess the AI practices scientists suggest for historians and others working on digital humanities.


## Credits

This project is heavily influenced by *Time*'s ["A to Z of Artificial Intelligence"](https://time.com/6271657/a-to-z-of-artificial-intelligence/), the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/about/) and IBM's ["The 2025 Guide to Machine Learning"](https://www.ibm.com/think/machine-learning#605511093). All three try to make this information transparent to the average person, but I needed something more tailored for my research that blends the technical with the approachable.
